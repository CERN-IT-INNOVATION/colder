colder package
==============

Welcome to the package documentation of `colder`. 
The library is structured as follows: some modules are provided to the user in order to input the physical system configuration and perform the main operations.
This is the case of the `main modules` (simulation and models).
The `support models` are the backbone of the library and provide lower level interface to various backends and core functionalities.
