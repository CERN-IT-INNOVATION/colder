Counterdiabatic Optimized Local Driving annealER
================================================

This package provides tool for Spin system simulation and optimization through a combination of Quantum Optimal Control and Counterdiabatic Driving techniques.
The framework allows to prompt the system through a simplified interface and automatically compute the minimization of the Adiabatic Gauge Potential (AGP) for a given ansatz.
